    text: "This app is designed to provide a simple way to manually control any parameters using either CV or MIDI CC. The MIDI channel and CC numbers can be adjusted in the app's settings, and both MIDI and CV outputs are always active simultaneously. The range can be adjusted using Shift + Fader, which affects both CC and CV ranges. The fader controls the level of the CV or CC, and the button acts as a clickless mute. The fader level and the mute state can be saved in scenes if the 'Store state' parameter is enabled (active by default). You can then use this app as a way to save and recall CV voltage allowing for preset in a modular system for example. The curve can be adjusted in the settings; however, this only affects the CV output. Two voltage ranges are available in the settings: 0V to 10V or -5V to 5V. Note that this range also affects the level at which CV and CC are set when muting. In the 0V to 10V range, mute is at 0V and CC 0, making it ideal for controlling volume, send levels, or similar parameters. In the -5V to 5V range, mute is at 0V and CC 64, making it suitable for controlling panning, crossfading, or similar functions. The mute behavior can be set to trigger on press or on release, depending on your preference. Due to popular demand, the app's action can also be inverted—this means that when the fader is at the top, the output will be set to the minimum value, and when at the bottom, it will send the maximum CC and CV value. As with all apps where the LED color does not serve any specific function, you are free to configure it in the settings.",

Shift + Button 1 provides a manual trigger, Shift + Fader 1 sets the trigger-to-gate timing, and Shift + Fader 2 controls attenuation. The envelope can also be triggered via MIDI, with the MIDI channel set in the parameters. An internal trigger-to-gate converter defines how long the gate stays active, ranging from 0 to 4 seconds—at maximum time, the gate remains on indefinitely. This timing behaves differently depending on the selected envelope mode: in AD mode, it prevents retriggering until the timer runs out; in ASR mode, it holds the envelope for the set duration; and in looping AD mode, it loops the envelope for the timer duration, with infinite looping at maximum time, effectively turning it into an LFO. MIDI note triggering is supported on a user-defined channel, allowing you to save channels by using MIDI directly instead of relying on a MIDI-to-CV gate. The 'MIDI retrigger' parameter allow for the envelope to be retriggered when MIDI notes are overlapping",

It can be set to send either MIDI CC or MIDI notes, while CV output is always active, sending 0–10V. The fader controls the probability of bit flips: when fully down, the sequence loops without changes; when fully up, bit flips occur constantly and the sequence length doubles; in the middle, there’s a 50/50 chance of flipping, resulting in the most randomness. Holding Shift and pressing the button a number of times sets the sequence length—for example, holding Shift and pressing three times sets a 3-step sequence, which is applied upon releasing Shift. The output is quantized for both CV and MIDI notes according to the global quantizer. Parameters include MIDI channel, base note (lowest MIDI note the Turing machine can generate), gate percentage (MIDI only), and color. Main functions include using the fader to set probability, Shift + Fader to set range, Shift + Button to set sequence length, and Button + Fader to set clock resolution (32ndT, 32nd, 16thT, 16th, 8thT, 8th, 4thT, 4th). While setting clock resolution, the bottom LED is orange for triplet divisions and blue for straight divisions.

- ext clock (pink)

In speed mode, incoming CV offsets the speed setting. In free-running mode this changes the internal interval, and in clocked mode it offsets the selected timing-resolution index. In ext clock mode, new random values are generated only when a rising edge is detected (around 1V after attenuation/mute processing). In slew mode, incoming CV modulates transition smoothing.

Channel 2 is the random output lane: Fader 2 sets base speed, **Shift + Fader 2** sets attenuation, and **Button 2 + Fader 2** sets slew. Use **Shift + short press** on Button 2 to mute/unmute output, and **Shift + long press** to toggle free-running versus clocked mode.

    text: "This app is a variation of the simple LFO, adding an assignable CV input. The first channel processes the CV input, with the fader controlling its attenuation and the button acting as a mute. Use Shift + Button 1 to set the CV destination, indicated by the button color: speed (yellow), phase (pink), amplitude (cyan) or reset (red). Note that the speed CV is through 0, meaning that the waveform will invert and speed up again when the CV input is negative. When in 'reset' mode, the LFO resets when a rising edge passing the 1V threshold is detected. It is also worth knowing that even in reset mode this input is affected by the CV attenuation and 'mute' state allowing to change the rising edge detection level. As in the standard LFO, you can select the waveform by pressing the second button, with LED colors showing the shape: sine (yellow), triangle (pink), ramp down (cyan), ramp up (red), and square (white). Adjust the CV output range using Shift + Fader. Shift + short press resets the waveform, while Shift + long press toggles between free-running and tempo-synced modes. Free-running speed ranges from 14 Hz to one cycle per minute; clocked mode offers resolutions like 16th, 8thT, 8th, 4thT, 4th, 2nd, note, half bar, and bar. App parameters let you set overall speed—Normal, Slow (÷2), or Slowest (÷4)—which also applies to clocked speeds. When clocked, the button flashes in sync with the LFO rate. Output can be bipolar (-5V to +5V) or unipolar (0V to 10V), affecting the attenuator's center when sending MIDI CC (0 for unipolar, 64 for bipolar). The app can also output MIDI CC, with freely configurable channel and CC number.",
